## Hi, I’m Félix Gasiaux </H1>
I am a 20 year old student in the little country of Luxembourg :) 
Feel free to take a look around, it is public for a reason.
I’m interested in everything tech and mechanics. In my freetime I enjoy working on personal projects ranging from electronics to programming to some light engineering.

- I have participated in multiple really fun projects:
  - The Mini Makerfair in Rosport in 2019, 2022, 2023
  - First Global Competition in 2019 representing Teams Luxembourg
  - CanSat in 2021 and 2022 and our team being selected to represent Luxembourg in the Europeoan Challenge in 2021
  - Vex Mentor for the 2023-2025 CodeClub Team in Luxembourg, winning 1st place in 2025 and going to Dallas
